# the-reads-recommendator-app
The initial idea of the app is to recommend randomly a read, could be a initially a book or article available (the reads type can increase in the future)


to run the app in a mobile device you need to install the app Expo Go (on Android and I also think that on IOS)

and execute this command: 

    npm start


which will create a QR code that you should scan using the Expo Go app and that will automatically run this amazing gorgeous app
